# Mental Helath Classification Models

This project explores the use of supervised machine learning to predict whether individuals are likely to seek mental health treatment, based on survey data. By analyzing a variety of demographic and psychological factors, the goal is to inform early intervention strategies and ensure equitable predictions across different population groups. The ultimate goal is to create high-performing models to predict whether a patient needs treatment or not.

# Project Overview

Using a mental health survey dataset, I built and compared three classification models:

- Decision Tree  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  

Each model was trained using 5-fold cross-validation, with hyperparameter tuning and threshold adjustment to optimize both performance and fairness. 

# Tools

- Language: R
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `corrplot`, `pROC`, `questionr`, `fairmodels`, `DALEX`,
- Techniques: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Machine Learning Models, Bias Mitigation, Fairness Metrics
